# Classification vs Regression

In supervised machine learning, problems are categorised between **"Classification"** and **"Regression"**.

In a **regression** problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output.

Example:
```
If we have an inventory of similar products, we want to know how many of them we can sell in the next 3 months.
```

In a **classification** problem, we are trying to predict results by mapping variables into categories.

Example:
```
Trying to classify if a new fruit is a banana or an apple based on the color and shape of the fruit.
```

```
(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

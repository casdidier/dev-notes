# CSS Reset

A **CSS reset** is short compressed/minified set of CSS rules that **resets the styling of all HTML elements** on a page to a consistent baseline.

Every browser has their own user agent stylesheet to make unstyled websites more readable.

*Ex: Most browsers make unvisited links blue and underlined and visited links purple, and apply different sizes to H1, H2, etc...*

With CSS reset, developers can **force browsers to reset all default styles** to null to **avoid cross-browsers differences**.

Example of tool: [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Some developers argue that css resets or normalizers are a bit useless and the same thing can be done with some CSS rules without having to add an extra stylesheet.

[This article](https://meiert.com/en/blog/stop-using-resets/) shows a few screenshots of website with and without CSS resets. The difference is sometimes so small that the use of a normalizer is not needed.

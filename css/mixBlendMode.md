# Mix Blend Mode

The `mix-blend-mode` CSS property describes how an element should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

Example:

Without `mix-blend-mode`:

<img src="images/mix-blend-mode-without.png">


With `mix-blend-mode: screen`:

<img src="images/mix-blend-mode-with.png">


If you want to remove the `mix-blend-mode` effect on an element, you can use `mix-blend-mode: unset`.

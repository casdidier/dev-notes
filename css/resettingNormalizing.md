# Difference between resetting and normalizing CSS

**Resetting CSS is removing all styles.**

**Normalizing CSS is preserving some useful defaults rather than unstyling everything.**

Normalize.css aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across all browsers.

For example, elements like h1 to h6 are bold.

The CSS Reset stylesheet is a basic template that wipe out all built-in styling for HTML elements.

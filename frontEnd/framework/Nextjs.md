## basic features

- Static exporting (pre-rendering)

  Next.js allows you to export your Next.js app at build time to static HTML that runs without a server. It is the recommended way to generate your website because itâ€™s done at build time and not at each request.

- Server-side rendering (pre-rendering)

It pre-renders pages to HTML on the server upon every request.

- Automatic code splitting

Unlike React, Next.js splits code automatically and only loads the JavaScript needed, which makes the app fast.

- File-system-based routing

Next.js uses the file system to enable routing in the app, meaning that every file under the pages directory will be treated automatically as a route.

- Hot reloading of code

Next.js relies on React Fast Refresh to hot reload your code, offering a great developer experience.

- Styling options

The Next.js framework has built-in support for Styled JSX, CSS modules, Sass, LESS, and more.

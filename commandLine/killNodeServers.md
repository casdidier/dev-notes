# How to kill all instances of Node servers

Errors like the following mean that the port you're currently running is already in use:

```
Error: bind EADDRINUSE
```

To fix this, you can either figure out what is running on the same port and kill only this instance, or decide to kill all node servers. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
killall node
```

All node servers should be stopped and you should be able to restart the ones you need.


# when you get this error Port is already in use

```
Something is already running at port 8080
? Would you like to run the app at another port instead? â€º (Y/n)
```

`kill \$(lsof -t -i:8080)

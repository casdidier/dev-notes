Instructor Notes
For users on Windows OS and using Git Bash you won't have a .bash_profile file. Don't worry I will explain to you how to create it.

1) If you're not in the home directory, change into it.

2) Create a file using touch .bashrc

3) Then edit it with Vim vim .bashrc

5) Save and close the file typing :wq and hit Enter.

6) Restart your Git Bash shell.

7) When you open your Git bash it will create a .bash_profile for you.

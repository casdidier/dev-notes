# Intro to design patterns

Over the years, developers have been facing the same problems over and over again. With the aim to help provide a common solution to these common problems, design patterns have been established to propose abstract solutions to be applied.

They represent years and years of untold redesign and refactoring by developers.

Design patterns are of different types (eg. Creational, Structural, Behavioral) and each type has different implementations (Builder pattern, Singleton, etc...)

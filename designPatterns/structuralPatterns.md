# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and identify simple ways to realise relationships between different objects.

They help ensure that if one part of a system needs to change, not the entire structure needs to do the same.

Patterns:

* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Adapter
* Proxy

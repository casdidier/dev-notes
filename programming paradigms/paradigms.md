# Functional programming (FP)

## FP with javascript

[Great book to start with FP](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide)

FP is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

FP is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

FP helps a lot `simplifying reading code`, then `maintain` and also by its design (no side effect or shared state) to `test`.

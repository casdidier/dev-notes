# Difference between a stack and a queue.

## Stack
---

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the **LIFO** (last-in first-out) principle.

It is a **limited access data structure**. Elements can be **added** and **removed** from the stack **only at the top**.

`push` adds an item to the top of the stack, `pop` removes the item from the top.

Easy analogy is to think of a stack of books.

A stack is a **recursive** data structure.
**A stack is either empty or it consists of a top and the rest which is a stack.**


### Queue
---

Container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the **first-in first-out FIFO** principle.

Example: line of students getting food. New additions to a line is made to the back of the queue, while removal happens in the front.
